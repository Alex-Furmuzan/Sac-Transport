                        <p>Often times it is hard to carpool with someone because of different school and work schedules. Another option and a popular one is driving yourself to school.
                            Though this mode of transportation seems to be the most convinient, it has its drawbacks.</p>

                        <h3> Carbon Emissions</h3>
                        <p>Did you know that buring one gallon of gasoline can create about 20lbs of CO2? This means that on average a single vehicle creates about 6-9 tons
                            of CO2 each year! According to the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, a 30MPG vehicle will save you rougly $3,000 in fuel compared to a 20 MPG vehicle.
                        </p>

                        <h3> Benefits and Drawbacks </h3>
                        <p> One benefit of driving yourself to campus is that you have the freedom to come and go as your schedule changes. Though this may seem like the obvious choice
                            for those of you who don't want to depend on others for rides to class, there are several major drawbacks of using this mode of transport. A few major drawbacks of
                            driving to campus alone include: contributing to the already major environmental problem by polluting the air with carbon emissions, along with increased traffic
                            and the limited parking spaces. Sometimes it's better to consider other modes of transportation like public transportation and the light rail or even carpooling.

                        <h3>Motorcycles</h3>
                        <p>If you're considering a motorcycle as your primary mode of transportation to the Sac State campus, buy your parking permit at the UTAPS office. Remember, that buying
                            a semester long permit in the beginning of the semester will save you a lot more money compared to if you buy a daily parking pass throughout the semester.
                        </p>
                        <p> A parking permit is only valid for the person who bought the parking permit. For motorcycles, it is advised to buy a repositionable parking permit
                            so you are able to move it to different parts on your bike.
